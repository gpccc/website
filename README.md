# GPCCC website version 2

The new website is being built using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/), [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) and [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/). The build toolchain is based on [react slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot).

1. **Set up the development environment**

    Follow the [Initial Machine Setup guide](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot#initial-machine-setup). Node version 12.19.0 and 14.15.1 are known to work well.

2. **Download the source code**

    `git clone https://github.com/gpchurch/website.git`

3. **Start the website**

    `cd website`<br />
    `npm start -s`

    "This will run the automated build process, start up a webserver, and open the application in your default browser. When doing development, this command will continue watching all your files. Every time you hit save the code is rebuilt, linting runs, and tests run automatically." --react slingshot
